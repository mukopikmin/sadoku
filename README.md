# Sadoku

`sadoku` is a local Markdown review tool for reading, previewing, and commenting
on one Markdown document in your browser.

Run its `start` command with a Markdown file path or an HTTP(S) URL. It starts a
local HTTP server, renders the source as HTML, prints the preview URL, and opens
that URL in your default browser. Review comments stay separate from local
Markdown files so the documents themselves stay clean.

## Install

On Linux and macOS, you can build in a temporary directory and install the
binary to `$HOME/.local/bin/sadoku`:

```sh
npm install
deno task install --version 0.1.0
```

Make sure `$HOME/.local/bin` is included in your `PATH`.

Or compile a standalone binary in the project directory:

```sh
npm install
deno task compile --version 0.1.0
./sadoku start README.md
```

If `--version` is omitted, the compiled binary reports the development version
`0.0.0-dev`. Pass the release version explicitly when building release binaries.

## Usage

```sh
sadoku start <file.md|url> [options]
```

Preview a file:

```sh
sadoku start README.md
```

Preview Markdown from a URL:

```sh
sadoku start 'https://example.com/README.md?token=temporary'
```

Use a different port:

```sh
sadoku start README.md --port 4000
```

If the requested port is already in use, `sadoku` increments it until an
available port is found.

Bind to a specific host and port:

```sh
sadoku start README.md --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4000
```

Print the URL without opening a browser:

```sh
sadoku start README.md --no-open
```

Keep the server running after the preview tab is closed:

```sh
sadoku start README.md --keep-alive
```

By default, the server reads the Markdown file or fetches the Markdown URL again
on each request, so refreshing the page shows recent edits. When a local
Markdown file changes, the browser preview shows a reload button so you can
refresh it when you are ready.

By default, the server stops after the browser tab is closed. Use `--keep-alive`
when you want to leave the server running.

Comments are stored outside the Markdown file's directory so they do not appear
as repository changes. The default comments directory is:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/sadoku/comments`
- Linux: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/sadoku/comments`, or `~/.local/share/sadoku/comments`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\sadoku\comments`

Set `commentsDirectory` in the Sadoku config file to choose a different comments
directory:

- macOS and Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sadoku/config.toml`, or
  `~/.config/sadoku/config.toml`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\sadoku\config.toml`

```toml
commentsDirectory = "/path/to/sadoku/comments"
```

For URL previews, comments are keyed by the URL without its query string or
fragment. The full URL is still used to fetch Markdown, so temporary tokens can
be present in the URL without splitting comments across multiple comment files.

List stored comment files:

```sh
sadoku comments list
```

Inspect unresolved comments for a Markdown source as JSON:

```sh
sadoku comments inspect README.md
```

Reply to a comment without resolving it:

```sh
sadoku comments reply README.md <comment-id> "Need more context."
```

Mark one or more comments as resolved:

```sh
sadoku comments resolve README.md <comment-id>...
```

The list shows each stored comment file, the target Markdown path, comment
count, unresolved comment count, and the latest `updatedAt` value from the
stored comments.

Remove all stored comments for a Markdown source:

```sh
sadoku comments rm README.md
```

The remove command prompts before deleting. Pass `--force` to skip the prompt:

```sh
sadoku comments rm README.md --force
```

## Comment Storage

Sadoku stores comments in the platform-specific application data directory by
default. Set `SADOKU_COMMENTS_DIR` to choose a different location.

For migration from mdview, Sadoku can still read `MDVIEW_COMMENTS_DIR`, existing
mdview comment directories, and legacy `*.mdview-comments.json` sidecar files.

## Options

| Option              | Description                                                | Default                |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `-p, --port <port>` | Starting port. Increments when in use.                     | `3334`                 |
| `--host <host>`     | Hostname or IP address to bind.                            | `127.0.0.1`            |
| `--no-open`         | Do not open the preview URL in your browser automatically. | Opens browser          |
| `--keep-alive`      | Keep the server running after the browser tab is closed.   | Stops after tab closes |
| `-v, --version`     | Print the CLI version.                                     |                        |
| `-h, --help`        | Print command help.                                        |                        |

## Browser Opening

`sadoku` opens the preview with the platform default opener:

- macOS: `open`
- Windows: `cmd /c start`
- Linux: `xdg-open`

Set `BROWSER` to choose the opener command explicitly. If the command contains
`%s`, `sadoku` replaces it with the preview URL. Otherwise, the URL is appended
as the last argument.

```sh
BROWSER=explorer.exe sadoku start README.md
BROWSER='chrome.exe --new-window %s' sadoku start README.md
```

## Development

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Run the CLI with Deno:

```sh
deno task start start README.md
```

Compile a standalone binary:

```sh
deno task compile
./sadoku start README.md
```

On Linux and macOS, build in a temporary directory and install the binary to
`$HOME/.local/bin/sadoku`:

```sh
deno task install
```

## Release Archives

The latest tested commit from `main` is published as the
[`v0.0.0-nightly`](https://github.com/mukopikmin/sadoku/releases/tag/v0.0.0-nightly)
prerelease. The tag and assets at that URL are replaced whenever the `Test`
workflow succeeds on `main`. Nightly binaries report version `0.0.0-nightly`.

Release tags always include a leading `v` (for example, `v0.0.0-nightly`), while
version values passed to builds and reported by the CLI omit it (for example,
`0.0.0-nightly`). Archive names retain the existing `sadoku-v<version>-<target>`
format.

Build release archives under `dist/`:

```sh
npm install
deno task dist --version 0.1.0
```

The release build creates archives for:

- `darwin-arm64`
- `linux-x64`
- `windows-x64`

To build a single target:

```sh
deno task dist --version 0.1.0 --target linux-x64
```

Each archive includes the `sadoku` binary, `LICENSE`, and
`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`. macOS and Linux targets are packaged as `.tar.gz`;
Windows is packaged as `.zip`. `dist/checksums.txt` and per-archive `.sha256`
files are generated for the final archives.

The release build uses the system `tar` command for `.tar.gz` archives and the
system `zip` command for the Windows archive. A full release build requires both
commands. A single-target build only requires the archive command for that
target.

For native targets, the release build starts the compiled binary on
`127.0.0.1:39731` to verify that bundled Mermaid assets can be served.

and installed package license files. `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` is generated at
release build time and is not committed:

```sh
npm install
deno task notices
```
