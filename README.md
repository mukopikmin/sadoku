# mdview

`mdview` is a small CLI for previewing one Markdown file in your browser.

Pass it a Markdown file path. It starts a local HTTP server, renders the file as
HTML, prints the preview URL, and opens that URL in your default browser.

## Install

On macOS, you can build in a temporary directory and install the binary to
`$HOME/.local/bin/mdview`:

```sh
npm install
deno task install:mac --version 0.1.0
```

Or compile a standalone binary in the project directory:

```sh
npm install
deno task compile --version 0.1.0
./mdview README.md
```

If `--version` is omitted, the compiled binary reports the development version
`0.0.0-dev`. Pass the release version explicitly when building release binaries.

## Usage

```sh
mdview <file.md> [options]
```

Preview a file:

```sh
mdview README.md
```

Use a different port:

```sh
mdview README.md --port 4000
```

Bind to a specific host and port:

```sh
mdview README.md --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4000
```

Print the URL without opening a browser:

```sh
mdview README.md --no-open
```

Keep the server running after the preview tab is closed:

```sh
mdview README.md --keep-alive
```

By default, the server reads the Markdown file again on each request, so
refreshing the page shows recent edits. The browser preview also reloads
automatically when the Markdown file changes.

By default, the server stops after the browser tab is closed. Use `--keep-alive`
when you want to leave the server running.

Comments are stored outside the Markdown file's directory so they do not appear
as repository changes. The default comments directory is:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/mdview/comments`
- Linux: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/mdview/comments`, or `~/.local/share/mdview/comments`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\mdview\comments`

Set `MDVIEW_COMMENTS_DIR` to choose a different comments directory.

## Options

| Option              | Description                                                | Default                |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `-p, --port <port>` | Port to bind. Must be between `1` and `65535`.             | `3334`                 |
| `--host <host>`     | Hostname or IP address to bind.                            | `127.0.0.1`            |
| `--no-open`         | Do not open the preview URL in your browser automatically. | Opens browser          |
| `--keep-alive`      | Keep the server running after the browser tab is closed.   | Stops after tab closes |
| `-v, --version`     | Print the CLI version.                                     |                        |
| `-h, --help`        | Print command help.                                        |                        |

## Browser Opening

`mdview` opens the preview with the platform default opener:

- macOS: `open`
- Windows: `cmd /c start`
- Linux: `xdg-open`

Set `BROWSER` to choose the opener command explicitly. If the command contains
`%s`, `mdview` replaces it with the preview URL. Otherwise, the URL is appended
as the last argument.

```sh
BROWSER=explorer.exe mdview README.md
BROWSER='chrome.exe --new-window %s' mdview README.md
```

## Development

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Run the CLI with Deno:

```sh
deno task start README.md
```

Compile a standalone binary:

```sh
deno task compile
./mdview README.md
```

On macOS, build in a temporary directory and install the binary to
`$HOME/.local/bin/mdview`:

```sh
deno task install:mac
```

## Release Archives

Build release archives under `dist/`:

```sh
npm install
deno task dist --version 0.1.0
```

The release build creates archives for:

- `darwin-arm64`
- `linux-x64`
- `windows-x64`

To build a single target:

```sh
deno task dist --version 0.1.0 --target linux-x64
```

Each archive includes the `mdview` binary, `LICENSE`, and
`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`. macOS and Linux targets are packaged as `.tar.gz`;
Windows is packaged as `.zip`. `dist/checksums.txt` and per-archive `.sha256`
files are generated for the final archives.

The release build uses the system `tar` command for `.tar.gz` archives and the
system `zip` command for the Windows archive. A full release build requires both
commands. A single-target build only requires the archive command for that
target.

For native targets, the release build starts the compiled binary on
`127.0.0.1:39731` to verify that bundled Mermaid assets can be served.

and installed package license files. `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` is generated at
release build time and is not committed:

```sh
npm install
deno task notices
```
