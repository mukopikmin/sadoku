# mdview

`mdview` is a small CLI for previewing a single Markdown file in your browser.

Run it with a Markdown file path, and it starts a local HTTP server that renders
the file as HTML, then opens the preview in your default browser.

## Usage

After compiling or installing the CLI:

```sh
mdview README.md
```

The printed local URL is also available if you want to open it manually.

During development, you can run the CLI with Deno:

```sh
deno task start README.md
```

Or compile a standalone binary:

```sh
npm install
deno task compile --version 0.1.0
./mdview README.md
```

If `--version` is omitted, the compiled binary reports the development version
`0.0.0-dev`. Pass the release version explicitly when building release binaries.

Or build release archives under `dist/`:

```sh
npm install
deno task dist --version 0.1.0
```

The release build creates archives for:

- `darwin-arm64`
- `linux-x64`
- `windows-x64`

To build a single target:

```sh
deno task dist --version 0.1.0 --target linux-x64
```

Each archive includes the `mdview` binary, `LICENSE`, and
`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`. macOS and Linux targets are packaged as `.tar.gz`;
Windows is packaged as `.zip`. `dist/checksums.txt` and per-archive `.sha256`
files are generated for the final archives.

The release build uses the system `tar` command for `.tar.gz` archives and the
system `zip` command for the Windows archive. A full release build requires both
commands. A single-target build only requires the archive command for that
target.

For native targets, the release build starts the compiled binary on
`127.0.0.1:39731` to verify that bundled Mermaid assets can be served.

On macOS, you can build in a temporary directory and install the binary to
`$HOME/.local/bin/mdview`:

```sh
npm install
deno task install:mac --version 0.1.0
```

Options:

```sh
mdview README.md --port 4000 --host 127.0.0.1
mdview README.md --no-open
```

The server reads the Markdown file on each request, so refreshing the page shows
recent edits. The browser preview also reloads automatically when the Markdown
file changes.

## Supported Markdown

| Feature | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Headings and paragraphs | Supported | Rendered through Markdown-it. |
| Bold and italic emphasis | Supported | `**bold**` and `_italic_` render as emphasis. |
| Unordered, ordered, and nested lists | Supported | Nested unordered and ordered lists are preserved. |
| Blockquotes and horizontal rules | Supported | Standard quote blocks and thematic breaks render normally. |
| Links and images | Supported | Link and image titles are preserved. |
| Inline code and fenced code blocks | Supported | Fenced code blocks are escaped by default. |
| Heading anchor links | Supported | Headings get stable `id` attributes and clickable anchors. |
| Plain URL autolinks | Supported | Plain URLs are converted to links. |
| Task list checkboxes | Supported | `- [ ]` and `- [x]` render as disabled checkboxes. |
| Strikethrough | Supported | `~~deleted~~` renders as deleted text. |
| GitHub-style tables | Supported | Table alignment markers are preserved. |
| Syntax highlighting | Supported | Common code fence languages are highlighted with highlight.js. |
| Mermaid diagrams | Supported | Fenced `mermaid` code blocks render in the browser. |
| Raw HTML | Not supported | Raw HTML is escaped for safer previews. |

Mermaid rendering is served from vendored local assets when a page contains a
Mermaid block.

The vendored Mermaid assets are generated from the npm dependency and are not
meant to be edited by hand:

```sh
npm install
deno task vendor:mermaid
```

Third-party license notices for release archives are generated from the lockfile
and installed package license files. `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` is generated at
release build time and is not committed:

```sh
npm install
deno task notices
```
